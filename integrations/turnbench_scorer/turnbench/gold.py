"""Gold construction: raw 3-annotator SRTs -> the EOT / Interruption event
sets the scorer anchors its eval windows on (turnbench/score.py).

This code is the source of truth for the gold — no consensus artifact is
published. The dataset ships only raw annotations (the
`speaker_{1,2}_annotation_{a,b,c}` event-list columns alongside the audio) and
the scorer builds the gold from them at scoring time, so the gold at a given
commit is fully determined by this file.

Stage 1 — consensus. An event is consensus iff at least MIN_AGREEMENT of the
three annotators (a, b, c) emit the same canonical label with (start, end)
intervals agreeing within TIME_TOLERANCE_S on both endpoints; the gold boundary
is the median across the agreeing annotators (MIN_AGREEMENT = 2, a majority).
LABEL_MAP below is the authoritative fine→canonical mapping. Agreement is judged at
the granularity each task needs — the taxonomy is hierarchical, "Turn" being
the coarser level above the interruption labels:

    turn view  — agreement on "does this span CLAIM the floor?" (Turn and
                 floor-taking-Interruption fine labels are one class). Drives
                 turns, and therefore EOT positives and pauses.
    label view — agreement on the canonical label. Drives the INT task
                 (Interruption onsets; Backchannel/NonContent extents).

Spans where no majority forms in a view become that view's *excluded*
intervals — a dissenting annotator whom the majority outvoted is settled, not
excluded, so only genuine no-majority regions are masked: the scorer ignores
predictions inside them, and pauses stop at them (disputed is unknown, not
silent).

Stage 2 — floor construction. Positives are anchor *times* (a window around
them is searched for a predicted event). Negatives are *spans* — stretches
where firing is a false positive:

    EOT negative  — a mid-turn pause, scored only while it is believably a
                    quiet within-turn hold: from the segment end until the
                    speaker resumes, truncated at the first excluded interval
                    (either speaker), the speaker's own non-floor vocalisation
                    (a backchannel mid-"pause" means they are listening), or
                    an other-speaker Interruption. Dropped if contaminated
                    from the start. Other-speaker backchannels do NOT truncate
                    — they are evidence the speaker holds the floor.
    INT negative  — a Backchannel / NonContent event's own extent: the other
                    speaker made a sound but did not take the floor.

The annotation is VAD-segmented, so one speaker's turn is many short segments
separated by gaps. A segment-end is a *real EOT* only when the floor passes to
the other speaker — they speak next, or are already speaking as the segment
ends; otherwise it is a mid-turn pause.

`Laughter` events are currently ignored for the floor — the Turn ∪ Laughter
floor rule (trailing laughter holds the floor) is deferred; see turnbench/README.md.
