"""TurnBench dev threshold-sweep: the probabilities files and their validation.

The sweep figure (paper Fig. 2) sweeps a single decision threshold over a model's
*continuous* per-frame probabilities on the dev set and scores each operating
point with turnbench.score. To make that reproducible without re-running anyone's
model, a submitter commits the raw per-frame probabilities — `probs-eot.json` for
the EOT sweep, `probs-int.json` for the interruption sweep. Each is the continuous
twin of a predictions JSON: instead of committed event times, a per-frame
probability per speaker, on a fixed frame grid. A model with only one head
commits only that task's file. One schema serves both, discriminated by `task`.

This module owns that schema and a strict, loud validator (mirroring
turnbench/submission.py): every dev conversation present exactly once, both speakers,
every probability finite and in [0, 1], and exactly one probability per frame on
the benchmark's canonical grid (`floor(duration * frame_rate_hz)`). The grid is
the benchmark's, not the submitter's — so when the sweep commits events it reads
their times from the grid, never from the file, and they are exact by
construction. Scoring (threshold -> Submission -> turnbench.score) lands on top of
this.

Dev only: there is no test probabilities file — test is scored from each model's
single committed `predictions-test.json` at its declared operating point.
