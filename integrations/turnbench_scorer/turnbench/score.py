"""Binary, event-anchored scoring of a predictions JSON against the gold.

A submission declares, per conversation and per speaker, the times (s) at which
it detects EOTs (that speaker's turn ending) and interruptions (that speaker
taking the floor from the other). Timestamps are commit times — the time by
which all audio the decision depended on has been heard. Predictions are read
only inside the scored regions from turnbench/gold.py; everywhere else they are
invisible (neither rewarded nor penalised).

Positive events at time t are searched in [t - TAU_PRE_S, t + TAU_MAX_S], with
the upper end clamped to this speaker's next event of the same task (a fire
past that point belongs to the next event, not this one, so the window must not
reach in and claim it). TAU_PRE_S is a matching tolerance (the gold boundary is
only annotation-exact), TAU_MAX_S the latency deadline. Each speaker is scored
on their own channel, so only same-speaker anchors bound the window. Matching is
one-to-one: positives are processed in time order and each claims the earliest
unclaimed prediction in its window, so one prediction can never satisfy two
events (TP, latency = t_pred - t) and a burst in one window is one detection.

Negative spans (mid-turn pauses, backchannels) are charged the same tolerance:
a prediction in [start - TAU_PRE_S, end] is a false positive — at most one per
span. Predictions claimed by a positive, or inside any positive window, are
exempt: a correct detection is never also an FP. Speculation is therefore
symmetric — firing just before a segment end is rewarded iff the turn really
ends there, and penalised iff the speaker was only pausing.

Metrics per task:

    recall  = TP / (TP + FN)
    fp_rate = FP / (FP + TN)      # negative spans that fired / all negatives
    latency p10/p50/p90 over TPs

Ranking: qualifiers (fp_rate within the ceiling) rank by recall; over-ceiling
submissions still show on the leaderboard, ranked below all qualifiers.

Usage:
    python -m turnbench.score predictions.json

Gold is built on the fly from the raw annotator tracks alongside the audio
(turnbench/gold.py) — that code is the source of truth for the gold. Data comes
straight from HuggingFace (cached locally; see turnbench/data.py); the eval server
points the same scorer at the private test set with `--dataset <private repo>`.
