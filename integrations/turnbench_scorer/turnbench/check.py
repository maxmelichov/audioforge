"""Pre-submission check: validate every file a baseline commits, in one command.

A baseline commits up to four files (see baselines/README.md):

    predictions-dev.json   predictions-test.json   probs-eot.json   probs-int.json

`python -m turnbench.check baselines/<name>` validates each one that is present and
prints a pass/fail line per file, so a submitter can confirm a fresh clone is
submission-ready before opening a PR. It needs no audio and no download — only the
committed per-conversation durations (turnbench/durations-{dev,test}.json) for coverage,
in-audio event times, and the probs frame grid. Validation only; it does not score
(dev scores are turnbench.score). predictions-test.json can *only* be validated this way
— it can't be scored locally, since test labels are withheld.
